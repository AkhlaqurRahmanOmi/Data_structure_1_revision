## Data Structure 1 Revision

This repository is dedicated to revising and reinforcing foundational concepts in **Data Structures**. It includes a collection of code implementations, algorithms, and problem-solving exercises focused on key data structures typically covered in an introductory data structures course. This project is intended to serve as a personal study resource, as well as a reference for others looking to brush up on these essential concepts.

### Contents:

- **Arrays and Strings:**
  - Implementation and manipulation of arrays and strings, including common operations like searching, sorting, and modifying elements.

- **Linked Lists:**
  - Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and reversal.

- **Stacks and Queues:**
  - Implementations of stack and queue data structures, including array-based and linked-list-based approaches, along with practical use cases.

- **Trees and Binary Trees:**
  - Basic and advanced tree structures, including binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- **Graphs:**
  - Introduction to graph theory, including graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), and fundamental graph algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).

- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms:**
  - A collection of commonly used sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort) and searching techniques (e.g., binary search, linear search).

### Purpose:

This repository serves as a comprehensive revision tool for students and professionals seeking to solidify their understanding of data structures. Each implementation is accompanied by comments and explanations to help reinforce the concepts and ensure clarity.

### How to Use:

- **Study:** Review the code implementations to understand the underlying principles of each data structure.
- **Practice:** Use the provided exercises to practice and test your knowledge.
- **Contribute:** Feel free to contribute additional examples, optimizations, or explanations to help improve this resource.

### Tech Stack:

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated with additional data structures and algorithms over time.
